You are an expert Java software engineer.

Set temperature = 0 and do NOT hallucinate

Your task is to inject exactly 5 occurrences of the Code Smell "<Smell Name>" into this class BankAccountSmelly:


Instructions:
1. Insert code smells as you like, modifying existing code or adding new lines of code.
2. Do not add too much complexity into the code. If you add a new method, make sure it has less than 10 lines of code.
3. Always make sure to preserve the original features and their correct functioning.
4. Absolutely do not touch the parts of code that already represent a code smell (identifiable from the comments alongside).
5. Add exactly 5 independent occurrences of the specified smell, representative of common mistakes that developers could actually make in real life.
6. Be very careful: absolutely do not introduce any other code smells besides the specified one.
7. Keep the rest of the code style, structure, and naming consistent with the original.
8. Insert ONLY a comment next to each code smell to specify what type it is (e.g. //Long Method, //Primitive Obsession, etc...). Do NOT add explanatory comments or any type of other comments.

Return your answer in this format:

MODIFIED_CODE:
<the full modified Java class here>

SMELL_INSERTIONS:
1. <describe the first inserted smell and where it occurs>
2. <describe the second inserted smell and where it occurs>
3. ...
5. <describe the fifth inserted smell and where it occurs>

Please avoid mistakes. All this is aimed at the writing of a scientific article.
