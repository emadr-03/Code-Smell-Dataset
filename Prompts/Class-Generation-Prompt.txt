You are a senior Java engineer.

Assume temperature = 0 and do not guess. If something is unclear or would require external assumptions, state “Not applicable with given constraints”. Make sure you fully understand the following instructions.

Generate ONE small, self-contained Java class that is TOTALLY clean and free of code smells, using Refactoring Guru’s code smell list that you provided me in this chat.

Use only the standard Java 21 SDK. No external libraries, no frameworks, no non-existent APIs, no internet calls.
Model a simple, concrete domain concept (e.g., Order, BankAccount, Book, or TemperatureSensor or others...). Pick one and keep it realistic and SIMPLE. Dont use complex constructs/structures.
Follow SOLID and OO best practices: clear responsibilities, proper encapsulation, cohesive methods, meaningful names.

Keep the class small (≈100–150 lines max).
Provide a minimal main demo showing typical usage (no I/O beyond System.out.println).
Dont write useless/avoidable comments.
Ensure the code compiles with javac as-is.

Print the final result only if all validation checks pass. Otherwise, explain briefly what prevents compliance.

Please avoid mistakes. What I am asking you is aimed towards the writing of an article that I will have to discuss at a conference. Any errors could cost me the rejection of the article.
